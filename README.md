## Downloading Legacy mods

## **Step 1**

Download a mod through the wiki [Link here](https://bridgepour.com/legacy-mods) or from the links above on the right side press download.

## **Step 2**

To get to the paks folder on your system type `%localappdata%\Mining\Saved\Paks` in the windows search or in `win + r` (run) and hit enter

## **Step 3**

Once the pak folder is open you can place the mod you downloaded into the paks folder and done you have now installed mods :) (example below)

## ❗❗❗**IMPORTANT**❗❗❗

The mod name is important therefore `(1)` isn't allowed behind the mod name e.g. `500-Hydrotility++_P (1).pak` you can fix that by removing the `(1)` behind the name (`500-Hydrotility++_P.pak`)
